TravelWeather
=============
**Travel Weather reads weather forecasts and synchronizes with your calendar to show you the weather at place where you'll be.**

Suppose, you'll do a road trip from New York to San Francisco. You are interested if the sun shines in New York on monday. On tuesday, you are in Pittsburgh, so you would like to know if you have to prepare for rain. And on wednesday, you are in Indianapolis and want to know if you can wear a T-Shirt.

*Until now, TravelWeather only has very basic functionality. New features will be added soon :)*
